## Drug Trial Prediction

### Problem
A number of hospital patients all suffering from the same illness were treated with a range of drugs
5 different drugs were available and the different patients responded differently to the different drugs
Problem - which drug is appropriate for any given future patient?

### Solution
Using machine learning neural network and C5.0 algorithms to build classification models that predict the correct type of drug for a patient based on various health metrics.
