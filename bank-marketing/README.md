## Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

### Problem

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The dataset has 4521 rows and 17 columns. The input variables (16 columns) include:
   - Client data: age, job, marital, education, load info
   - Last contact of the current campaign: contact type, when, duration
   - Other attributes: number of contacts of current campaign, number of contacts of previous campaign, outcome of previous campaign

The output variable (desired target):
  - subscribed: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: ‘yes’, ‘no’)

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

### Solution

Using machine learning algorithms to build classification models that predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The model was built on SPSS Modeler on IBM Data Science Experience and/or IBM Watson Studio.
